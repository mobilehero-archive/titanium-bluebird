# Introduction

Bluebird is a fully featured promise library with focus on innovative features and performance

See the [**bluebird website**](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html) for further documentation, references and instructions. See the [**API reference**](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html) here.

For bluebird 2.x documentation and files, see the [2.x tree](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/tree/2.x).

### Note 

Promises in Node.js 10 are significantly faster than before. Bluebird still includes a lot of features like cancellation, iteration methods and warnings that native promises don't. If you are using Bluebird for performance rather than for those - please consider giving native promises a shot and running the benchmarks yourself.

# Questions and issues

The [github issue tracker](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues) is **_only_** for bug reports and feature requests. Anything else, such as questions for help in using the library, should be posted in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bluebird) under tags `promise` and `bluebird`.
