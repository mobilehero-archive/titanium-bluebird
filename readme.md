ðŸ›‘ &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.axway.com/mobile-apps/prepare-your-apps-for-appcelerator-end-of-support">Axway has already shut down support</a> for most of their Amplify products related to mobile and cloud. 
</h4>

<h4 align="center">
A few of the open-source versions of Axway Amplify products will live on after Axway Amplify End-of-Life (EOL) announcements.  However, all closed-source projects and most open-source projects are now dead.

> ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp;&nbsp; A group of Axway employees, ex-Axway employees, and some developers from Titanium community have created a legal org and now officially decide all matters related to future of these products.

# Introduction

Bluebird is a fully featured promise library with focus on innovative features and performance

See the [**bluebird website**](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html) for further documentation, references and instructions. See the [**API reference**](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html) here.

For bluebird 2.x documentation and files, see the [2.x tree](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/tree/2.x).

### Note 

Promises in Node.js 10 are significantly faster than before. Bluebird still includes a lot of features like cancellation, iteration methods and warnings that native promises don't. If you are using Bluebird for performance rather than for those - please consider giving native promises a shot and running the benchmarks yourself.

# Questions and issues

The [github issue tracker](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues) is **_only_** for bug reports and feature requests. Anything else, such as questions for help in using the library, should be posted in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bluebird) under tags `promise` and `bluebird`.
